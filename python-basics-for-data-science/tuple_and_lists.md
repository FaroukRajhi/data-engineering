# Tuples

Are are an ordered sequence
Are written as comma separated lists elements within parentheses.
Example:
Ratings =(12,3,67,12,90)

**Tuple nesting**

NT = (1,2,("pop","rock"),(3,4))

# Lists
Are also ordered sequences
L = ["name", 12]

We can nest other lists:

L = ["name", 12, [3,4]]

We can add other tuple
L = ["name", 12, ("A", 1)]


Check tuples and lists methods documentation

concatenate the following lists <code>A = [1, 'a']</code> and <code>B = [2, 1, 'd']</code>:
A = [1, 'a']
B = [2,1,'d']
A + B
