# Date/Time

Dates consist of three-part values for the year,
month, and day. And times also generally consist of a three part value for the hours, minutes,
and seconds. A timestamp column is a combination of both and consists of seven parts: year, month,
day, hour, minute, second, and microsecond. Other commonly used data types include:

# Boolean

hold one bit of information 0 or 1

# Binary string

. A binary string which holds a sequence of bytes
that represent image, voice, or other media data


# Large object or LOB

such as  file. Often this type of data is stored outside of the main database
table and a pointer to it is held in the table

# XML

can store platform agnostic
unstructured data in a hierarchical form. In addition to the various built-in data types
