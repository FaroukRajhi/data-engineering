When and where the transformations happen:
Transformations for ETL happen within the data pipeline before data reach the destination.
For ELT happen in the destination environment

- Flexibility

ETL is rigid - pipelines are engineered to user specifications
ELT is flexible - end users build their own transformations

- Support for big data:

Organizations use ETL for relational data, on-premises - scalability is difficult.

ELT solves scalability problems, handling both structured and unstructured big data in the cloud.

-  Tome-to-insight:


ETL workflows takes time to specify and develop.
ELT supports self-serve, interactive analytics in real time.
