- Optical Character Recognition(OCR):
Which is used to interpret and digitize text scanned from paper documents so it can be stored as a computer-readable file.

- Analog-to-digital converters (ADC):
Can digitize analog audio recordings and signals and charge-coupled devices (CCD) that capture and digitize images.

- Database querying:

SQL or NoSQL queries

- Edge computing devices:
Such as video cameras that have built-in processing that can extract features from raw data.

- Biomedical devices, such as microfluidic arrays that can extract DNA sequences from
