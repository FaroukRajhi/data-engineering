A data lake is a storage repository that can store large amounts of structured, semi-structured,
and unstructured data in their native format, classified and tagged with metadata.
While a data warehouse stores data processed for a specific need, a data lake is a pool
of raw data where each data element is given a unique identifier and is tagged with metatags for further use.
