A data pipeline typically runs with a combination of complex tools and can face several different types of performance threats.

# Performance threats include:

- Scalability in the face of increasing data sets and workloads.
- Applications failures.
- Scheduled jobs not functioning accurately.
- Tool incompatibilities.

# Data pipeline - Performance Metrics:

Latency - The time it takes for a service to fulfill a requests.
Failures
Resources utilization 
Traffics

# Troubleshooting

1. Collect as much information as possible.
2. Check the right version of the software
3. Check logs and metrics.

# Database optimization for performance

Let's first understand the performance metrics that needs to be monitored in a database.
These include:
System outages
Capacity utilization
Application slowdowns
Performance of queries
Conflicting activities and queries being executed simultaneously.
Batch activities

**Best Practices**

- Capacity planning: Determine the optimal hardware and software resources required for performance.
- Database Indexing: Locating data without searching each row in database resulting in faster querying.
- Database Partitioning: Dividing large tables into smaller, individual tables, improving performance and data manageability.
- Database Normalization: Reducing inconsistencies arising out of data redundancy and anomalies arising out of update, delete, and insert operations on databases.
- Monitoring systems: and alerting.
- Maintenance schedules: Maintenance routines
