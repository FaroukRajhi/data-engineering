The field of data engineering concerns itself with the mechanics for the flow and access of data.
Its goals is to make quality data available for fact-finding and data-driven decision making.
Tasks:
**Collecting source data**
Extracting, integrating, and organizing data from disparate sources.
Data acquisition from multiple sources
Data architecture for storing source data

**Processing data**
Cleaning, transforming, and preparing data to make it usable.
Maintain Distributed systems for processing data
Design pipelines for extracting, transforming, and loading data.
Implement solutions for safeguarding quality, privacy, and security of data.
Optimize tools, systems, and workflows for performance, reliability, and scalability.

**Storing data**
Implement data stores for storage of processed data.
Scalable systems
Ensure tools and systems are in place that take care of data privacy, security, compliance

**Making data available to users securely**
Use APIs, service, and programs for retrieving data for end-users
User access through interfaces and dashboards
Checks and balances to ensure data security
