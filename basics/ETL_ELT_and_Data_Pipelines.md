# ETL (Extract, Transform, and Load Process)

Is how a raw data is converted into analysis-ready data.
Is an automated process which includes:
Gathering raw data
Extract the information that aligns with your reporting and analysis needs.
Cleaning, standardizing and transforming data into usable format
Load it into the data repository

# ELT (Extract, Load, and Transform Process)

Extracted data is first loaded into the largest system and transformations are applied in the target system.
The destination system for an ELT pipeline is most likely a data lake, through it can also be a data warehouse.
Is useful for processing large sets of unstructured data and non-relational data

# Data Pipeline

Encompasses the entire journey of moving data from one system to another, including the ETL process.
Can be used for both batch and streaming data.
