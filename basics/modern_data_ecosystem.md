# Data Sources

Data is available in a variety of structured and unstructured datasets.
Residing text, image, videos, IOT, etc.
When you working with so many different sources of data, the first step is:
Pull a copy of the data from the original sources into data repository.
Raw data needs to get organized, clean up, optimized for access, and conform to compliances and standards enforced in the organization.
